                        answer: 'Every pet move is different, which makes standard pricing difficult to establish. Factors like pet size, breed, origin, destination, and even time of year can all come into play when determining costs. The pet driver will determine what makes sense for them. ',

                        answer: 'You only pay when you accept a bid. Stripe Payment Systems processing all payments and has a separate secure platform. You then pay the pet driver with a code when the delivery is completed. ',

                        answer: 'Understandably, most pet owners would rather keep their pets by their side when they fly, but airline and country rules often make this impossible. Tiny pets can sometimes fly in the cabin, especially if youâ€™re flying within the United States, but most international flights require pets to fly via cargo.',
